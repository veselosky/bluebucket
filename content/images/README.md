# Note on images

Some images in this directory were generated using an online tool,
[WebSequenceDiagrams.com](https://www.websequencediagrams.com/). To facilitate
modification and pull requests, I have included the "source" for each image, the
recipe for Web Sequence Diagrams, as a `.txt` with the same name as the `.png`
image. You can paste this text into the tool and modify to generate new versions
of the image.
 
 Other images are drawn using [OmniGraffle for Mac][]. The OmniGraffle files are
 included in the repository, though obviously you will need a compatible drawing
 program to edit them. Sorry about that.
