# Note on images

Some images in this directory were generated using an online tool,
[WebSequenceDiagrams.com](https://www.websequencediagrams.com/). To facilitate
modification and pull requests, I have included the "source" for each image, the
recipe for Web Sequence Diagrams, as a `.txt` with the same name as the `.png`
image. You can paste this text into the tool and modify to generate new versions
of the image.
