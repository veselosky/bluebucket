# AWS Configurations

This directory contains files storing the AWS configurations for various
services that are part of the Blue Bucket system, to aid in making it
reproducible. These files are specific to this project, but should serve as
examples to be used in other projects.

If I get some round tuits, I may produce re-usable templates.

Note to self: run all the JSON files through python -mjson.tool to prettify
them.
